# TODO — NetDesign AI

Read this first each session. Repo is green: `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:golden`
/ `pnpm typecheck` (TypeScript workspace, now including `scripts/`) and
`services/vsdx`'s `pytest` (Python, separate venv) both pass as of the
state below.

## Where things stand (after Session 4 — Phase 0 complete)

- TS workspace unchanged in shape from Session 2: `packages/schema`,
  `packages/design-engine`, `packages/llm-extraction`. 79 tests, all green.
- **`services/vsdx`** (new — first and only place Python is used, per
  CLAUDE.md): a FastAPI service, `POST /export` (design JSON in, `.vsdx`
  bytes out, `Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-visio.drawing`) and
  `GET /healthz`. Own venv at `services/vsdx/.venv`; `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
  then `pytest` (34 tests). Not wired into the pnpm workspace — it's a
  separately-deployed Python service, so it stays outside `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
  - `app/models.py`: pydantic mirror of `design-schema.json` (Python's
    counterpart to `packages/schema`'s zod validators). Strictly typed for
    devices/links/segments/meta (what this service renders);
    routing/security/cloud are permissive passthrough dicts since nothing
    here reads them. `tests/test_models.py` drift-guards the `Literal` enums
    against the canonical `packages/schema/src/design-schema.json` by
    relative path — same role as `schema-drift-guard.test.ts` on the TS side.
  - `app/vsdx_builder.py`: `build_vsdx_bytes(design)` — one rectangle shape
    per device (fill color by role, `app/colors.py`), grid-laid-out (max 4
    cols, page grows to fit), device id/role/vendor/hostname/mgmtIp/loopback/
    zone embedded as real Visio **Shape Data** (custom properties, not just
    text). One connector per link via `vsdx.Connect.create()`, skipping any
    link with an end outside the device list (`renderable_links()`).
  - `app/templates/blank.vsdx`: checked-in binary template every export
    starts from — `vsdx.VisioFile(path)` can only *open* a file, there's no
    "create blank" API. Derived from vsdx's own bundled `media.vsdx` (its one
    demo shape stripped out) rather than hand-built, because a from-scratch
    minimal OOXML zip is missing pieces `vsdx.Connect.create()` needs when it
    lazily bootstraps the connector master. Regenerate via
    `app/templates/generate_blank_template.py` (only needed if the `vsdx` pin
    changes). See `services/vsdx/README.md` for the full why.
  - `app/structural_validator.py`: `validate_vsdx_structure(bytes, design)` —
    unzips, checks required OOXML parts, and cross-checks shape count
    (`devices + renderable_links`), `<Connect>` count (`2 * renderable_links`),
    and that every device's Shape Data actually matches that device (not
    just that some shape exists). This is NOT the golden-`.vsdx`-file
    comparison CLAUDE.md describes for real-Visio-validated exports — that's
    a Session-4 weekend-gate concern once export *quality* is being judged.
  - Fixed a `vsdx==0.6.1` bug in `_fix_connector_trigger_formulas()`:
    `Connect.create()`'s formula rewrite drops a `.` (`Sheet1!` instead of
    `Sheet.1!`), which wouldn't break vsdx's own round-tripping but likely
    breaks a real Visio's live re-glue tracking.
  - `tests/fixtures/g{1,4}_*.json` are hand-transcribed from the TS
    composer's G1/G4 snapshot output (`packages/design-engine/test/golden/
    __snapshots__/`) — same golden scenarios, both languages, kept in sync
    by eye for now (no automated cross-language sync yet).
  - **Found and fixed two real bugs via the weekend-gate check, mid-session**:
    the founder tried opening the G1 export in draw.io and got "Cannot read
    properties of null (reading 'getElementsByTagName')".
    1. First fix (insufficient on its own): `Connect.create()` re-bootstraps
       the connector master's `[Content_Types].xml` `<Override>` and
       `document.xml.rels` `<Relationship>` entries on *every* call (its
       existence check never holds true in this in-memory-zip flow), so
       G1's 5 links produced 6 duplicate entries for the same masters
       `PartName` — invalid per the OPC spec. Fixed, re-exported, founder
       retried in draw.io — **same error**.
    2. Real root cause: `vsdx` never calls `ET.register_namespace()`, so
       every part it re-serializes (`document.xml`, `page1.xml`, `pages.xml`,
       `pages.xml.rels`) gets Python's auto-generated `ns0:` prefix instead
       of the unprefixed default real Visio uses. draw.io's importer matches
       tags/attributes as bare string literals (`child.tagName ===
       "PageContents"`, confirmed by fetching and reading draw.io's actual
       importer source from GitHub, since this session's network policy
       blocks `app.diagrams.net` itself) — every one of those silently fails
       against a prefixed tag. Fixed with a per-file post-save pass
       (`_repackage()` in `vsdx_builder.py`, replacing the narrower
       `_dedupe_opc_metadata()`) that registers each part's own namespace as
       default immediately before re-serializing *that specific part* — a
       single upfront registration can't work here since
       `ET.register_namespace("", uri)` is a shared global slot and
       `save_vsdx()` writes multiple differently-namespaced parts in one call.
    Both are regression-tested in `structural_validator.py`
    (`_check_opc_metadata_integrity()`, `_check_no_generated_namespace_prefixes()`)
    and `tests/test_structural_validator.py`. Full writeup with the debugging
    trail in `services/vsdx/README.md`. **WEEKEND GATE: all 3 targets
    confirmed clean by the founder** — draw.io, LibreOffice Draw, and real
    Microsoft Visio (via OneDrive's free web viewer, substituting for a
    desktop license per BUILD_PLAN's "(or Visio web viewer)" allowance).
    G1 and G4 both open without errors in all three.
- **`scripts/generate-design.ts`** (new — BUILD_PLAN Session 4's "wire
  engine → vsdx service end-to-end via a CLI script"): `pnpm generate --
  --fixture g1|g4` composes a golden scenario directly (no LLM call, no
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed — the params are inlined in the script, not
  imported from test/ code) or `pnpm generate -- --prose "<text>"` runs the
  full `user prose → design-params → design JSON` pipeline via
  `@netdesign/llm-extraction`, then POSTs the result to a running
  `services/vsdx` instance's `/export` and writes the `.vsdx` to disk
  (`--out`; `--design-json-out` to also dump the intermediate JSON).
  Clear, human-readable errors for the two obvious failure modes: vsdx
  service unreachable (with the exact command to start it) and missing
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Root `package.json` gained a `dependencies` block
  (workspace packages) and a `tsconfig.json` (so `pnpm typecheck` covers
  `scripts/` too, via `tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` after the per-package
  loop) — first time either was needed at the root. Verified for real:
  started the vsdx service locally, ran both `--fixture g1` and `--fixture
  g4` end-to-end, and confirmed the resulting `.vsdx` files pass
  `validate_vsdx_structure()`. `--prose` wasn't live-tested (no API key in
  this environment) but its error-guard path (missing key, `--prose` +
  `--fixture` both given) was.

## Next step (Session 5, per BUILD_PLAN.md)

**Phase 0 is done.** The CLI wiring (`scripts/generate-design.ts`) works
end-to-end, and the WEEKEND GATE passed clean on all 3 targets (draw.io,
LibreOffice Draw, Visio via OneDrive). The remaining judgment call from
BUILD_PLAN's gate — "would you hand this to a client after ≤15 min of
cleanup?" — is the founder's, not something to self-certify here; note the
answer in this file next session if it hasn't been settled explicitly.
Assuming yes: Phase 1 starts, BUILD_PLAN Sessions 5-6 — "Build the Next.js
app: Supabase auth (email magic link), projects table, a prompt page that
calls the pipeline, and a React Flow canvas rendering the design JSON with
role-based node icons and zone grouping. Deploy to Vercel; deploy
services/vsdx to Railway." This is the first session that touches
`apps/web` — nothing there yet.

## Notes / decisions made without asking (boring-option calls)

- `services/vsdx` is a standalone Python project (own `pyproject.toml`, own
  `.venv`), not part of the pnpm workspace — it's deployed separately per
  CLAUDE.md, so there was never a reason to fold it into the TS tooling.
- Devices only — VLAN/segment shapes are not drawn on the diagram this
  session. The task was "shapes per device role, connectors per link,"
  segments weren't asked for, and adding them would have meant inventing an
  unrequested visual convention (grouping box? separate shape type?)
  without a golden scenario to anchor the decision against.
- Router↔router / redundancy-group visual grouping (e.g. a dashed box around
  an HSRP pair) also not drawn — same reasoning, not asked for, and a real
  design opinion better made once real Visio output has actually been judged
  in the Session-4 weekend gate.
- Shape Data field list (id/role/vendorHint/hostname/mgmtIp/loopback/zone)
  is deliberately a fixed, hand-picked subset of Device's fields, not "every
  field on the device" — `interfaces[]` isn't flattened into shape data
  since it's a list, not a scalar, and doesn't have an obvious single-value
  representation in a custom property.
- `scripts/generate-design.ts`'s G1/G4 presets are copy-pasted from
  `packages/design-engine/test/golden/fixtures/`, not imported — a script
  meant to be run by a human (and to prove the pipeline works from outside
  the test suite) shouldn't depend on test-only code. Accepted the small
  duplication/drift risk over that coupling.
- Root `package.json` needed `@types/node` for the first time (nothing
  before `scripts/` used Node built-ins/`process` in code that TS actually
  type-checked from the repo root — `packages/llm-extraction`'s own
  `process.env` usage typechecks fine standalone because `@types/node`
  comes in transitively via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`'s own dependency tree,
  which isn't visible from the root). Pinned to `^22` to match the Node
  version this environment and Node 22+ deploy targets actually run.

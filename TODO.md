# TODO — NetDesign AI

Read this first each session. Repo is green: `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:golden`
(TypeScript workspace) and `services/vsdx`'s `pytest` (Python, separate venv)
both pass as of the state below.

## Where things stand (after Session 3)

- TS workspace unchanged in shape from Session 2: `packages/schema`,
  `packages/design-engine`, `packages/llm-extraction`. 79 tests, all green.
- **`services/vsdx`** (new — first and only place Python is used, per
  CLAUDE.md): a FastAPI service, `POST /export` (design JSON in, `.vsdx`
  bytes out, `Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-visio.drawing`) and
  `GET /healthz`. Own venv at `services/vsdx/.venv`; `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
  then `pytest` (29 tests). Not wired into the pnpm workspace — it's a
  separately-deployed Python service, so it stays outside `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
  - `app/models.py`: pydantic mirror of `design-schema.json` (Python's
    counterpart to `packages/schema`'s zod validators). Strictly typed for
    devices/links/segments/meta (what this service renders);
    routing/security/cloud are permissive passthrough dicts since nothing
    here reads them. `tests/test_models.py` drift-guards the `Literal` enums
    against the canonical `packages/schema/src/design-schema.json` by
    relative path — same role as `schema-drift-guard.test.ts` on the TS side.
  - `app/vsdx_builder.py`: `build_vsdx_bytes(design)` — one rectangle shape
    per device (fill color by role, `app/colors.py`), grid-laid-out (max 4
    cols, page grows to fit), device id/role/vendor/hostname/mgmtIp/loopback/
    zone embedded as real Visio **Shape Data** (custom properties, not just
    text). One connector per link via `vsdx.Connect.create()`, skipping any
    link with an end outside the device list (`renderable_links()`).
  - `app/templates/blank.vsdx`: checked-in binary template every export
    starts from — `vsdx.VisioFile(path)` can only *open* a file, there's no
    "create blank" API. Derived from vsdx's own bundled `media.vsdx` (its one
    demo shape stripped out) rather than hand-built, because a from-scratch
    minimal OOXML zip is missing pieces `vsdx.Connect.create()` needs when it
    lazily bootstraps the connector master. Regenerate via
    `app/templates/generate_blank_template.py` (only needed if the `vsdx` pin
    changes). See `services/vsdx/README.md` for the full why.
  - `app/structural_validator.py`: `validate_vsdx_structure(bytes, design)` —
    unzips, checks required OOXML parts, and cross-checks shape count
    (`devices + renderable_links`), `<Connect>` count (`2 * renderable_links`),
    and that every device's Shape Data actually matches that device (not
    just that some shape exists). This is NOT the golden-`.vsdx`-file
    comparison CLAUDE.md describes for real-Visio-validated exports — that's
    a Session-4 weekend-gate concern once export *quality* is being judged.
  - Fixed a `vsdx==0.6.1` bug in `_fix_connector_trigger_formulas()`:
    `Connect.create()`'s formula rewrite drops a `.` (`Sheet1!` instead of
    `Sheet.1!`), which wouldn't break vsdx's own round-tripping but likely
    breaks a real Visio's live re-glue tracking.
  - `tests/fixtures/g{1,4}_*.json` are hand-transcribed from the TS
    composer's G1/G4 snapshot output (`packages/design-engine/test/golden/
    __snapshots__/`) — same golden scenarios, both languages, kept in sync
    by eye for now (no automated cross-language sync yet).
  - Manually spot-checked: exported G1 to `.vsdx`, confirmed `file` IDs it as
    "Microsoft Visio 2013+" and it round-trips through `vsdx.VisioFile()`
    itself. **Not yet opened in real Visio/draw.io/LibreOffice** — that's
    explicitly a human weekend-gate step (BUILD_PLAN Session 4), not
    something to fake from this session.

## Next step (Session 4, per BUILD_PLAN.md)

Wire engine → vsdx service end-to-end via a CLI script. Then the WEEKEND
GATE: open the G1 and G4 exports in real Visio (or Visio web viewer),
draw.io, and LibreOffice Draw. Judge: would you hand this to a client after
≤15 min of cleanup? If no, Phase 0.5 (fixing export quality) comes before
any UI work — see BUILD_PLAN.md's framing, this gate is the whole point of
Phase 0.

## Notes / decisions made without asking (boring-option calls)

- `services/vsdx` is a standalone Python project (own `pyproject.toml`, own
  `.venv`), not part of the pnpm workspace — it's deployed separately per
  CLAUDE.md, so there was never a reason to fold it into the TS tooling.
- Devices only — VLAN/segment shapes are not drawn on the diagram this
  session. The task was "shapes per device role, connectors per link,"
  segments weren't asked for, and adding them would have meant inventing an
  unrequested visual convention (grouping box? separate shape type?)
  without a golden scenario to anchor the decision against.
- Router↔router / redundancy-group visual grouping (e.g. a dashed box around
  an HSRP pair) also not drawn — same reasoning, not asked for, and a real
  design opinion better made once real Visio output has actually been judged
  in the Session-4 weekend gate.
- Shape Data field list (id/role/vendorHint/hostname/mgmtIp/loopback/zone)
  is deliberately a fixed, hand-picked subset of Device's fields, not "every
  field on the device" — `interfaces[]` isn't flattened into shape data
  since it's a list, not a scalar, and doesn't have an obvious single-value
  representation in a custom property.
